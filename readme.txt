Hide/show the WordPress toolbar in the front-end.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin to hide/show the WordPress toolbar in the
front-end of the site, while leaving it alone in the admin section.

The toolbar is hidden by default, and clicking 'Show' in the top left
makes it appear. It can be hidden again by pressing 'Hide'.

The plugin was inspired by the originally excellent but now abandoned 'Admin
Bar Minimiser' plugin written by
<a href="http://www.presscoders.com">David Gwyer</a>. The javascript
and css styles used by this plugin are based on that code, but aside
from that this plugin is a much more limited (and lightweight)
implementation of the concept. There are no settings, no ability to
minimise in the admin screen, and no other frills. The main reason to use
this plugin instead of 'Admin Bar Minimiser' is that this works with sites
that can use SSL, and that one doesn't.
